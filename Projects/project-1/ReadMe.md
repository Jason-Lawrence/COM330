I am a MS/BS Computer Science student specializing in Cyber Security at the Illinois Institute of Technology. My passion
for Cyber Security stems from growing up and seeing the damage done to genuine and honest people from cyber-attacks.
My interests in Cyber Security are Biometrics, Firewalls, and Malware Detection. While I am passionate about Cyber 
Security, I am also interested in many other areas such as: Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Software Engineering. 
hope to use the knowledge and skills I obtain to improve user's experience with technology.

While at Illinois Tech I had many academic accomplishments, I joined Dr. David Minh's Molecular Biology Research Group as
a research assitant. I mainly assisted with writing python scripts to perform calculations on datasets collected by
fellow researchers in the group. I was also accepted into the Co-terminal program, which allows its undergraduate 
students to pursue a Master's degree alongside their Bachelor's. This was a great opportunity for me because it allowed 
me to take more Cyber Security oriented classes.

During my time at IIT I joined the Alpha Xi Chapter of Alpha Sigma Phi Fraternity. I learned many valuable lessons and 
skills that translate well to the workplace. I had many opportunities to go to National Leadership Conferences as the 
Vice President of Recruitment for our Greek Council as well as being the President of my Fraternity. VP of Recruitment 
taught me how to engage with potential new members, sell them the benefits of joining our organization, and most 
importantly how to get them to comeback again. Being President taught me many life lessons and leadership skills. It was 
through these skills and lessons that I was able to work with others to elevate our Chapter.
