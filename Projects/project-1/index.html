    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>I am a MS/BS Computer Science student specializing in Cyber Security at the
      Illinois Institute of Technology. My passion for Cyber Security stems from
      growing up and seeing the damage done to genuine and honest people from
      cyber-attacks. My interests in Cyber Security are Biometrics, Firewalls, and
      Malware Detection. While I am passionate about Cyber Security, I am also
      interested in many other areas such as: Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and
      Software Engineering. I hope to utilize the knowledge and skills I have obtained
      to improve user’s experience with technology.</p>

    <p>While at Illinois Tech I had many academic accomplishments, I joined Dr.
      David Minh’s Molecular Biology Research Group as a research assitant. I mainly
      assisted with writing python scripts to perform calculations on datasets
      collected by fellow researchers in the group. I was also accepted into the
      Co-terminal program, which allows its undergraduate students to pursue a
      Master’s degree alongside their Bachelor’s. This was a great opportunity for
      me because it allowed me to take more Cyber Security oriented classes.</p>

    <p>During my time at IIT I joined the Alpha Xi Chapter of Alpha Sigma Phi
      Fraternity. I learned many valuable lessons and skills that translate well to
      the workplace. I had many opportunities to go to National Leadership
      Conferences as the Vice President of Recruitment for our Greek Council as well
      as being the President of my Fraternity. VP of Recruitment taught me how to
      engage with potential new members, sell them the benefits of joining our
      organization, and most importantly how to get them to comeback again. Being
      President taught me many life lessons and leadership skills. It was through
      these skills and lessons that I was able to work with others to elevate our
      Chapter.</p>

    <h2>Ambitions</h2>

    <p>As I am graduating this semester I really want to build a website to help
      display my Portfolio beyond my resume. I am hoping this class will give me the
      skills to do just that. Other than that I wanted to explore a field of computer
      science that I haven’t touched during my time at Illinois Tech.</p>

    <p>My future plans after I graduate are to hopefully get a job in Austin
      Texas. I was born in Texas, so I'd like to go back there. As for the job,
      I'd like to work in Biometrics however any CS job would be great to get.
      For long-term though, I would love to open my own Cyber Security firm that
      would do government contracts, or consultant work.</p>
